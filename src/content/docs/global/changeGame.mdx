`GAME.changeGame` moves a player to a given map, and takes options to configure the type of lobby created or joined.

## Examples

```krnk
# Sends the player to any existing lonely_castle lobby that has default settings.
# If none are available, a new one is hosted.
GAME.changeGame("lonely_castle");

# Additional options can be set with the second argument.
GAME.changeGame("lonely_castle", { private: true, host: true });
