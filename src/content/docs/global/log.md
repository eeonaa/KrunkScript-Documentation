`GAME.log` is Krunkscript's version of [console.log](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/log_static). Messages will appear in the developer console.

## Examples

```krnk
GAME.log("Text");                           # logs text to the browser console
GAME.log(object);                           # logs object to console
GAME.log((str) number + "text");            # combine number with text

# You can cleanly chain variables together in a log like this:

GAME.log("test", "test2", 6, [0, 1, 2]);    # returns: test test2 6 [0, 1, 2]

```
