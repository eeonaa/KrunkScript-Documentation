`GAME.SCENE` contains some functions to assist with modifying the environment.

## Skybox

```krnk
# single color
# Set sky color (single color)
GAME.SCENE.setSkyColor(
    "#fff"
);

# gradient, and additional settings
GAME.SCENE.setSkyDome(
    "#fff",
    "#fff",
    "#fff",
    {
        texture: "27997",            # asset id
        emissive: "#ff0000",         
        emissiveTexture: "27998",    # asset id
        textureMoveAxis: 0,          # 0 - 1 OR "x" - "y"
        textureMoveSpeed: 0          # speed (-20 - 20)
    };
);

# remove it
GAME.SCENE.removeSkyDome();
```

## Fog

```krnk
GAME.SCENE.setFog(
    "#fff",
    100         # distance
);
```

## Global lighting

<Aside type="tip">
    Global lighting can be costly performance-wise. As an alternative, you can place individual light objects around the map (todo link to page).

```krnk
# Adjust the in-game sun
GAME.SCENE.setSkyLight(
    "#fff",
    2,          # light intensity (0 - 3)
    20,         # sun angle x (0 - 360)
    20,         # sun angle y (0 - 360)
    100         # light distance (10 - 15000)
);

# Adjust the in-game ambient light
GAME.SCENE.setAmbientLight(
    "#fff",
    2           # light intensity (0 - 3)
);
```
